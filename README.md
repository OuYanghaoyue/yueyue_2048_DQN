# yueyue_2048_DQN
Play the 2048 with RL Nerul Net Work, implement the DQN and mc serch algorithm

Although I adjust the weights and some parameters, but it's only achive 1024.

So I use a Montcarl to play this game,but it's only achive 2048 can't surpass 2048 achieve 4096 or bigger.

## How to play?

run the main.py to train the network and you can also change the param in the utils.py befor run main.py

You can run ai_algo.py to play ,it can reach 2048 almost every times, and sometimes can reach 4096
